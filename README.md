This is something I am trying to come up with. 

    ``Date Beginning: Saturday, October 7th 2023``

So I am trying to create an autonomous self Driving object.

I won't be so specific and say a Car. 




```graph.js```

/*
    A graph are Data Structures made from nodes known as
            Vertices
            And a set of edges called links
    They can be bidirectional. 

    I will learn about geometry and try to implement this with
    spatial graphs

    and each points will be connected with one segment.
